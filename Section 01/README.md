## Course Structure & Guidance

### Guidance

- In this lesson, we are going to provide some guidance on how you can do this course. It is a master course and hence, it is pretty long and can be overwhelming.
- So, we want to provide some guidance so that it can be approached in a more effective and a systematic way.
- Guidance will also be provided for new college students who are just getting started with Java.
- You can view the course as consisting of two parts.
- The first part would be core Java, and it is also very in-depth. This would be around 50% to 60% of the course, and that would amount to around 40 to 45 hours with roughly around 17 to 18 sections which we will look at shortly.
- This would cover most of these topics:
  - Language Basics
    - Language Basics such as for-loops
    - Concepts of Inheritance and Polymorphism
  - Eclipse
    - How to use Eclipse in a professional way
  - Exceptions
  - Input/Output
    - How to read data from files and how to write data to files.
  - In-built Data Structures
  - Generic Basics
    - We will explore a concept called Generics, and we will look at the basics.
    - In the second part of the course, we will do the remaining part of generics.
- Once you have mastered this, only then move on to the second part.
- After finishing all of this, if you are not feeling confident, then tkae some time off and review the sections once again.
- Once you feel confident and comfortable, then move on to the second part, which is advanced java.
- This would include some concepts like:
  - Advanced Generics
  - Multi-threading
  - Databases & JDBC
    - Specifically we will cover SQL and the MySQL database
    - How to interact with databases from our Java programs
  - Functional Style Programming
    - This is about concepts like Lambdas and streams
  - Introduction to Java EE
    - This helps in developing web applications using Java Stack
    - We will not get into the in-depth of Java EE, because this course is not about Java EE.
    - We will explore some core web technologies like servlets and GSPs.
  - Others
- Both these parts have these things in common:
  - Design rules
  - Best practices
  - Project
- So, if you are a Java aspirant, if you want to become a Java professional, you have to do this entire course.
- If you are a college student then this would suffice:
  - Language Basics
  - Eclipse IDE
  - JVM & Project (Optional)
  - Exceptions
  - Input/Output
  - In-built Data Structures
  - Generics Basics
  - Multi-threading Basics
- This is for only first or second year undergrad students, and you can do it according to your curriculum.
- But at some point before you graduate, like your third or final year, it is a strong suggestion to complete the rest of the course too i.e. the advanced part, including the project which you should implement.
- That way, you would have an end-to-end experience in building a Java based web application and that can be helpful with on-campus interviews and you would also do well once you aer hired, especially having learned the best practices.
- So, if you want to apply for Java jobs, you should complete the course.
- Also, if you are currently a Java professional, and not comfortable with any of the topics for example, functional programming or multi-threading, then you can just do those specific sections as they are in-depth.

### Course Structure

- The course is divided into sections.
- A section is like a chapter and it has some lessons.
- As mentioned earlier, the first 17-18 sections would comprise of core Java part.
- The first part would end in Section 17: Generics, and within generics you can do the first 5 lessons up until the lesson "Project Extension: Replacing Arrays with ArrayLists (Part 2)".
- The second part of the course will be the remaining of Section 17 and the rest of the sections of the course.

### General Suggestions

- Make sure that you are concentrating really hard because a lot of details are packed into every single lesson.
- So, if you miss your concentration then you are going to miss something.
- Do not rush through any of the lessons, do them systematically and if needed, take notes.
- If you are not clear about something, then just review the lesson one or more times and that should be helpful.
- If you still have questions, post them in Q&A section.
- Make sure to implement demos. This is a programming course and hence you need to program. So, implement everything that is being demonstrated.
- Similarly, do all of the exercises, put in the effort to solve those exercises and that will give you a lot of confidence because they validate what you hav learned.
- The book "Effective Java" by Joshua Bloch is an intermediate/advanced level book so, it doesn't teach any core concepts, but we do cover some of the best practices that are covered in the book - we do it in our own way.
- You don't have to buy this book, everything is clearly explained. Maybe later in the second half of the course, if you still want to buy, then you can.
- The other two books for reference are "Head First Java" which is very good introductory book, it teaches you the basics using nice graphics; and the other one is "Harnessing Java" by Kishori Sharam, is also an introductory book, it covers all of the details, it is not just an introduction.
- Again, these books are for references and you don't need to buy them for this course unless you want to.
