# Section 02: Java - A High-Level Overview

**About:** This section nicely builds on each topic to give you a solid, high-level understanding of Java. At the end of this section we will also run our first Java program. We begin the section by broadly defining what Java is. We will next discuss the motivation behind creating Java. This should help us understand why certain features that are unique to Java were introduced, and one of the features is Platform Independence. But, before learning platform independence, we need to first understand what platform dependency is. In the process, we also learn about what compilation is, which should be very useful for complete beginners. But to understand platform independence, we also need to understand about interpretation as it helps achieve platform independence. So, we discuss about interpreters. Then we discuss about how Java achieves platform independence. We then take a look at JVM which is kind of the soul of Java platform. It is a very important topic, and we also have a separate, dedicated Section to it. Java software family involves multiple platforms for developing applications for different types of devices like web servers, desktops, and mobile devices. Java SE is one of those platforms, and is also a core platform within the Java family; and this course is about Java SE platform. So, we will install Java SE and the entire installation process will be demostrated step-by-step. Finally, we will code our first Java program and compile and execute it. So, that's the agenda of this section. Note that coding exercises will actually start from next section. That's because this section is basically a high-level introduction to what Java is, and so it is more about theory. Although we write a basic "Hello, world!" program at the end of the section, the real language features will be introduced only from next section onwards. Now, without any further delay, let's get started with this section.
