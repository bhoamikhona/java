# Section 03: Classes, Objects, and Their Members

**About:** In this section we will get started with the language basic series which also includes a few other follow up sections. As the title of the section suggests, we will look classes, something called objects, and the fundamental units that make up classes and objects.

## Agenda

- Let's look at the agenda for this section.
- Java is an <ins>object-oriented programming language</ins> and so, we begin the section by discussing about <ins>object-oriented environment</ins> and its use in modeling real-world scenarios.
- For this we will introduce Java's two of the most fundamental object-oriented concepts called <ins>class</ins> and <ins>object</ins>.
- We'll understand this concepts conceptually and also see how they can be created in Java.
- We will next look at some absolute basic coding constructs in Java which we need to know before we start programming in Java.
- Our next few lessons will include an in-depth coverage of variables.
- A variable is a basic unit of a class and is responsible for holding data i.e. it is basically like a container.
- Now, while a variable in its very basic form can hold a single value, we often also need variables that can hold a group of values; and for that we can use an array.
- So, we next look at an array which would be our first data structure of the course.
- An array is also one of the most basic data structures any programming language supports.
- Other sophisticated data structures will be discussed in the collections framework section, which comes later in the course.
- While variables help with holding a software's data, a software also needs something to encapsulate its business logic, and that's where methods come in.
- Our next few lessons will include an in-depth coverage of methods.
- Like a variable, a method is also a basic unit of a class.
- So, a software's business logic or algorithms will be part of methods.
- Finally, we will look at something called constructors which as the name implies, help in constructing something and that something would be objects.
- So, constructors help with creating objects.
- That's the agenda.

> [!TIP]
>
> In this course we take a top-down approach in learning the basics of the Java language i.e. instead of getting into the nitty-gritty details of the language, we first understand how Java as an object-oriented programming language helps model real world scenarios using classes and objects; and then we look their constituent components.
>
> We will also write several demo programs as we go alone and you will also be given a few coding exercises that would help validate and also reinforce what you have learned.
